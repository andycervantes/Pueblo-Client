Howdy, Beta tester!

You're one of a few fortunate souls selected because of your stunning
computer expertise, your ability to probe the weaknesses of new
products and suggest improvements, and because you're our friend.

My guess is that you're ready to start...

USING PUEBLO
------------

Once Pueblo is extracted, you can run it from the Program Manager or the File
Manager.  The program name is 'Pueblo.exe'.  (On Windows NT or Windows95, you
can run Pueblo from the command line.)

Pueblo will ask you to agree to our beta agreement.  If you press 'Accept',
the program will run.  (If you don't accept you can't use the program.
Sorry.)  You'll only be asked this once for each version of the
program you use.

When the login dialog box appears, select a user name and enter the password
you wish to use, then press the 'Create New Account' button.  (Note that the
button will be disabled until you type a username, and a password that is at
least 6 characters long.)  If someone is already using the name you've
selected, you'll be asked to enter another one.

After you press the 'Create New Account' button, Pueblo will ask you for some
information on yourself.  When you've filled in the information, your account
will be created.

Your Pueblo account allows you to download world lists from us.  We intend to
keep these world lists up-to-date, eliminating worlds that no longer exist and
adding worlds that we discover.  If we're missing a world that you would like
to let us know about, you can send a letter to world-list@Chaco.com.
Include the world name, address, and a short description of the world.  If you
wish, you can also suggest a category for the world (i.e., Educational,
Social, etc.)

NOTE that your Pueblo account is not associated with your name and password
for each world you visit.

Later you may press the 'Sign on' button to use the account.  Simply select
the user name (we keep track of them in a pop-up list box), enter your
password, and press the 'Sign on' button.

*** If you can't connect to the Pueblo server, please send EMail to the
    mailing list.  (See information on the mailing list below.)  Include as
    much information on your machine (type of processor, OS and Window system,
    WinSock library) as you know.  If we need more information, we may want
    to call you, so let us know when you can be reached.

ONCE YOU'RE ONLINE
------------------

Pueblo uses a hypertext interface.  Select one of the highlighted words to
jump to that world or category of worlds.  When you select a world, you
will be connected to that world if it is available.

Here you're on your own.  We plan on providing a help file and expanding
Pueblo usage information.  Please let us know what you need to know, and
where our interface is confusing.

If you want to give us feedback, you need to be on...

THE MAILING LIST
----------------

If you haven't already done so, please subscribe to the Pueblo beta-testers
mailing list.  Send EMail to Pueblo-Beta-Request@chaco.com, with the word
'subscribe' in the body of your letter.  This is the mailing list for
discussing your thoughts on our product, bugs you find, things we should
improve, favorite recipes for tiramisu, etc.

Anyhow...

WELCOME TO THE PUEBLO BETA PROGRAM!
-----------------------------------

Pueblo is a network game system that brings you together with other
fun-loving folks on the internet.  We think if we bring different
cultures, ages, and backgrounds together on the internet, we can make
the world a much nicer place.

The point of the Pueblo beta program is to make sure Pueblo is helping
you get the most out of MUDs, MUSHes, etc.  So, when an improvement
idea for Pueblo crosses your mind, drop us a line.  If you see a bug,
let us know immediately so we can fix it.  Just send mail to
pueblo-beta@chaco.com.

Don't tell anybody anything about Pueblo, or about the beta program.
They'll get to play soon enough, and the quality will be better
because you've helped us test it.

Your feedback on Pueblo is the main reason why you're getting a chance
to play early.  You have to send us feedback--what you like and
dislike about Pueblo--in order to continue receiving updated Pueblo
releases.

Thanks for helping bring the world together!  Have fun!

Your pals,
The Pueblo Development Team
